**Data Science Capstone Project**

This app is created as a partial fulfilment of the Data Science Capstone,
part of the Data Science Specialization offered by
Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

The word prediction app is based on the n-gram language model on the
[HC Corpora](http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/).

In this Shiny app, there are elements of reactive programming, dynamic UI and user interactivity.
